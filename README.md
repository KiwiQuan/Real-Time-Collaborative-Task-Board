# Real-Time Collaborative Task Board (SSE Practice)

This project is a practice application for learning and mastering Server-Sent Events (SSE) in Node.js. It is a simplified, real-time collaborative task board similar to a basic version of Trello where multiple users can create, update, and delete tasks on shared boards. All changes are instantly broadcast to every connected client using SSE, allowing users to see updates in real time without refreshing the page. The project uses in-memory data storage for simplicity and focuses on building a scalable, well-structured Node.js backend.
